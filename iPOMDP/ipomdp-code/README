To run tests with the ipomdp/ifsc, you will want a little script like
the following (already in the various problem domain folders):

dir_name = 'tiger';
solver_type = 'ipomdp';
action_type = 'stochastic_forward_search'; 
for rep = 1:10;
    hyper.gamma = 10;
    hyper.alpha = 1;
    tester( dir_name , action_type , solver_type , rep , hyper )
end

* The dir_name is the directory in which one can find (1) a file named
dir_name.mat with a matlab structure problem in Spaan's format 

* The solver types are: em, em_big, ipomdp, ffbs, and ffbs_big, where
EM is expectation-maximization on a finite model and FFBS is
forward-filtering backward-sampling on a finite model.  The _big means
we use a finite model = 10*state_count, generally to show that
over-estimating the number of underlying states isn't necessarily a
good idea.

* The action types are: stochastic_forward_search, epsilon_greedy,
boss, beb, weighted_stochastic, and softmax.  Weighted stochastic runs
quickly and performs about as well as the more principled forward
search.  BOSS and BEB have a few implemenation quirks, use with care!

* Gamma and alpha are the base and leaf concentration parameters of
the HDP, respectively.
